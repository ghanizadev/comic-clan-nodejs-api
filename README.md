## Conception

Build a complete REST API to be consumed by a new social network focused in comic books. The client has the following requests:

- Built along with NodeJs and ExpressJs framework;
- Secure endpoints protected by a OAuth2.0 authentication method;
- Support to GraphQL;
- Microservices pattern;
- Scalable and flexible;
- CORS;

## First Ideas

- Use continuous integration;
- Clean code and redability with SonarQube and ESlint;
- Upload Images using AWS S3 free tier;
